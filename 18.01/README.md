# 18.01

In this file I am going to report what I have done with this course.

Since I have already taken [18.01](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/index.htm) 
(in OCW) on my own in the past I'm just doing the practice exams and the exams. I used 3 cheat sheets to refresh the content.

These are the resources that I have used:
- [Calculus cheat sheet](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/pdf/Calculus_Cheat_Sheet_All.pdf)
- [Series cheat sheet](http://furius.ca/cqfpub/doc/series/series.pdf)
- [Polar coordinates cheat sheet](http://www.math.psu.edu/tseng/class/Ch11formulas.pdf)
