# 18.01

In this file I am going to report what I have done with this course.

Since I have already taken [18.01](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/index.htm) 
(in OCW) on my own in the past I'm just doing the practice exams and the exams. I used 3 cheat sheets to refresh the content.

Up to now I have taken the first exam.
